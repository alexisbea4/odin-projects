<p>A cinnamon roll is a sweet pastry made by rolling dough with a cinnamon and sugar filling, then baking it. It's often enjoyed as a breakfast item or dessert, with variations like cinnamon buns and cinnamon snails. The dough is typically a yeast-leavened sweet dough, spread with a butter, sugar, and cinnamon mixture, then rolled, sliced, and baked. </p>

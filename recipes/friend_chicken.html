<p>Fried chicken is a dish made by coating pieces of chicken (like drumsticks, thighs, wings, or breasts) in a seasoned flour or batter mixture and then cooking them in hot oil until the outside is golden brown and crispy while the inside stays juicy and tender.

It’s often seasoned with spices like salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, or herbs to give it extra flavor. The crispy coating comes from the flour or batter frying in the hot oil, creating a crunchy shell, while the chicken itself cooks through from the heat.

The result is a savory, crunchy, juicy dish that’s often eaten hot, sometimes with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits.</p>

            <p>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.</p>
